# GeneraGame

Two modules here, making up one library, one for Swift and one for ObjC:

## GeneraGame

The game-specific code, used to generate and draw terrain. Has everything non-generic outside the generic engine. Will
also contain shaders eventually.

## GeneraGameData

The Objective-C component of `GeneraGame` - contains headers to actually render terrain.
